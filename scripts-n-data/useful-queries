NOT IN PERFECT ORDER

SELECT T3.stop_id, T2.trip_id, T2.stop_sequence, T3.stop_name 
FROM 
trips AS T1
JOIN
stop_times AS T2
    ON T1.trip_id=T2.trip_id AND route_id = 6122 AND direction_id = 0
JOIN 
stops AS T3
    ON T2.stop_id=T3.stop_id
GROUP BY T3.stop_id
ORDER BY T2.stop_sequence;


WORKS WELL

SELECT T2.arrival_time, T2.departure_time 
FROM 
trips as T1
JOIN
stop_times as T2
    on T1.trip_id = T2.trip_id AND route_id = 6122 AND direction_id = 0
JOIN
stops as T3
    on T2.stop_id = T3.stop_id and T2.stop_id = 11785
ORDER BY T2.arrival_time;
