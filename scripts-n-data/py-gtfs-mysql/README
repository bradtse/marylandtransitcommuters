GTFS MySQL IMPORT SCRIPT
Author: Tom Lee (thomas.j.lee@gmail.com)

This is a simple set of scripts that will import a GTFS dataset into
a lightweight MySQL database.  The work is based on Washington, DC's
WMATA GTFS dataset, and has not been thoroughly checked for completeness
against the GTFS spec -- some optional fields or tables may not 
currently be supported (but should be trivial to add).

In addition to the GTFS fields, a number of columns have been created
to assist in the conversion of GTFS's string-based date/time 
representations to more useful Unix timestamp-style second counts.

DEAD-SIMPLE USAGE:

1. Create a database, e.g. CREATE DATABASE gtfs

2. Run table creation scripts against the database:

	cat sql/*.sql | mysql -p -u USERNAME -h HOST -D gtfs
	
3. Edit settings.py with your mysql details.

4. Put your GTFS files into the gtfs/ folder

5. Run the import script:

	python load_gtfs.py
	
6. Run the time index creation script:

	python build_indices.py
	
7. Build something neat
