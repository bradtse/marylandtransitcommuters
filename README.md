Maryland Transit Commuters Android App
==========
A simple app that is used to determine upcoming bus times. It is very basic at
the moment but I plan on adding for features soon.

Note:
This app requires ActionBarSherlock which can be found
[here](http://actionbarsherlock.com/). I plan on including the library in this
repository in the future, but right now you have to download it yourself.

Known bugs:
